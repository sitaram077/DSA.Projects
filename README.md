This repository is my personal homage to the wonderful world of data structures and algorithms! 
Here, I've built a collection of classic games, each one a brick in the foundation of my engineering journey.
Fueled by a thirst for knowledge, I've devoured books and YouTube tutorials, transforming theoretical concepts into playable experiences.
These games aren't just mindless entertainment; they're testaments to the power of code and the elegance of data structures.

Current Games:

A formal snake game : A captivating journey through a snake which tends to increase it's size by eating colourful food around the garden. I've used arrays concept in implemnting this.

Sudoku_solver: This solves the sudoku puzzles.


This is Just the Beginning!

My quest for engineering knowledge continues!  As I explore new algorithms and data structures, expect this repository to expand with even more engaging and mind-bending games.
