This repository is my personal homage to the wonderful world of data structures and algorithms! 
Here, I've built a collection of classic games, each one a brick in the foundation of my engineering journey.
Fueled by a thirst for knowledge, I've devoured books and YouTube tutorials, transforming theoretical concepts into playable experiences.
These games aren't just mindless entertainment; they're testaments to the power of code and the elegance of data structures.

Current Games:

## A formal snake game : 
* A captivating journey through a snake which tends to increase it's size by eating colourful food around the garden. I've used arrays concept in implemnting this.

## Sudoku_solver: 
* This solves the sudoku puzzles.

## PIG Dice Game

**Technical Overview**

Pig is a simple, turn-based dice game for two players. The objective is to be the first player to reach a target score (commonly 100). Players take turns rolling a single die and accumulate points based on the roll. However, rolling a 1 (one) results in losing all points earned that turn.

**Gameplay**

1.  **Turns:** Players alternate turns.
2.  **Rolling:** On your turn, you can roll the die as many times as you like. Each non-1 roll adds to your current turn total.
3.  **Holding:** You can choose to "hold" after any roll. This means you bank your current turn total and end your turn.
4.  **Rolling a 1:** If you roll a 1, you lose all points earned that turn and your turn ends.
5.  **Winning:** The first player to reach or exceed the target score wins the game.

**Technical Considerations**

* The game can be implemented using various programming languages. 
* Core mechanics involve:
    * Random number generation for simulating die rolls.
    * Player score tracking and updating.
    * Detecting win conditions. 
* The game can be extended with features like:
    * Multiple dice.
    * Turn timers.
    * Computer opponent.

**Further Resources**

* You can find various Pig dice game implementations online including: Simple command-line versions, graphical user interfaces (GUI), and web-based versions. 



This is Just the Beginning!

My quest for engineering knowledge continues!  As I explore new algorithms and data structures, expect this repository to expand with even more engaging and mind-bending games.
